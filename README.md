# RESTAURANT REVIEWS ANALYSIS




# Introduction

- Automate detection of different sentiments from textual comments and feedback, A machine learning model is created to understand the sentiments of the restaurant reviews. The problem is that the review is in a textual form and the model should understand the sentiment of the review and automate a result. 
- The main motive behind this project is to classify whether the given feedback or review in textual context is positive or negative. 
Reviews can be given to the model and it classifies the review as a negative review or a positive. This shows the satisfaction of the customer or the experience the customer has experienced.
- The basic approach was trying a different machine learning model and look for the one who is performing better on that data set. The restaurant reviews are very related to the project topic as reviews are made on websites and we can apply this model on such data sets to get the sentiments.
